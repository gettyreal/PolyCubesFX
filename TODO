TODO list
 
- implementing rotation and translation methods to make final confrontation of each polycube
- implementing a graphic interface to visualize all of the polycubes
    the inferface should be able to:
    - visualize the polycubes
    - get a input of how many cube should be generated
    - maybe the process of confrontation visualized (non necessary)

- commenting and documenting the code to prevent ai accusations
